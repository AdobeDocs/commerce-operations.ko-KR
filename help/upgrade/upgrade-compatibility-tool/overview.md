# Overview of the Upgrade Compatibility Tool

>[!NOTE]
>
>업그레이드 호환성 도구는 Adobe Commerce 인스턴스에만 사용할 수 있습니다.

The Upgrade Compatibility Tool is a command-line tool that checks an Adobe Commerce customized instance against a specific version by analyzing all modules and core code installed in it. It returns a list of critical issues, errors, and warnings that must be addressed before upgrading to the latest version of Adobe Commerce. It also identifies potential problems that must be fixed in your code before attempting to upgrade to a newer version of Adobe Commerce.

The Upgrade Compatibility Tool allows you to identify when core code changes have been made to customized features. 자세한 내용은 [도구 실행](../upgrade-compatibility-tool/run.md) 주제 를 참조하십시오.

It is distributed as a Composer package with every release of an Adobe Commerce version. See the [Developer](../upgrade-compatibility-tool/developer.md) topic for more information.

Refer to the [Install](../upgrade-compatibility-tool/install.md) for the first steps with the Upgrade Compatibility Tool.
